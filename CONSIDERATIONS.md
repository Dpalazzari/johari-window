The purpose of this document is to address the need to have accessible software to all users.

#### Physical Considerations

The entire app is tab friendly. As in, any user can navigate the site using the tab key on their keyboard.

  - Use tab to select the desired element.
  - If the desired element is a checkbox, hit the space bar to select the desired checkbox.
  - The user can enter their desired information by selecting buttons with tab and then hitting the enter key.

#### Visual Considerations

The app is pretty user friendly for people who have color-blindness. The App has styles and colors that are friendly to almost all forms of color-blindness.

  - The colors may change, but users can still see the difference between elements on the page
  - The exception to this rule is for users with [achromatopsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatopsia)
      - Achromatopsia is known as total color blindness
      - Inconsistency if people afflicted with Achromatopsia are completely color-blind or not
      - This is a very rare form of color-blindness; however, users afflicted with it can still see black/white/grey. This may make some aspects of the app more difficult to work with, but not so much as to make the app insufferably unusable.

It would take some patience and effort to navigate the app blindly. With ChromeVox, there are a couple of situations in particular that would be confusing or frustrating.

  - In a couple places, the app has greyed out, unclickable links or buttons that become clickable after certain conditions are met.
      - In ChromeVox, it still makes these elements sound like they are available links to click, which they are not. For instance, on the my assignments route, if the user has already submitted a Johari for another person, ChromeVox still says that person's name is still a clickable link, even though it is not.
      - The same can be said for the submit button when users are submitting a Johari for another user. The button does not become clickable until 15 adjectives are selected. A blind person has no way of knowing this.
  - Those are the only two struggles for someone who had their eyes closed and a pretty good familiarity with the app. It would more than likely be a different experience for a blind newcomer to the site.
