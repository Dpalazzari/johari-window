# Johari Window App
## Quick overview

This is a tool developed at the Turing School, based on the [Johari Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window) Exercise developed in 1955 by Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham. It is a front-end app that works with our Rails backend [Johari Window API](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/johari_window_api).
